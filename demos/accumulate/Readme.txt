The circuit adds the N to itself A times (Result = N x A),
which is displayed on the LEDR lights

In this demo:

-- the number to be accumulated, N, is the value of SW[4:0]
-- the number of accumulations, A, is the value of SW[9:5]
-- KEY[0] is use to start the calculation

To use:

1. set a value, N, using SW[4:0]
2. set a value, A, using SW[9:5]
3. Toggle KEY[0]
