# ** Note: (vsim-3812) Design is being optimized...
# ** Warning: (vsim-3865) Due to PLI being present, global +acc is being enabled automatically. This will cause your simulation to run very slowly. Please use vsim -no_autoacc to disable this feature. This feature is now deprecated and will be removed from future releases.
