# DESim

The DESim tool is an interactive graphical user interface showing features of a DE-Series board, such as switches, lights, and displays. The tool interfaces with the ModelSim simulation software. The simulation results affect the lights and displays in the GUI, as opposed to showing the waveforms corresponding to the signals being simulated.

The DESim tool has three parts:
1) The frontend graphical user interface
2) The backend simulator interface
3) Various demos showcasing the different capabilities of the tool

The DESim tool requires the ModelSim HDL simuator. Preferably, one of the ModelSim-Intel FPGA editions, which has the Intel FPGA IP Core simulation models built-in.
