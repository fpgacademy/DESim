In the QuestaSim distribution, there is a file called mtipli.lib in Windows,
and one called libmtipli.so in Linux. On my windows computer,
I found it in $QUESTASIM_INSTALL_DIR/win64/mtipli.lib, and on
my Linux computer, I found it in $QUESTASIM_INSTALL_DIR/linux_x86_64/libmtipli.so.

Copy the mtipli.lib (or libmtipli.so on Linux) file into this directory.
