In the modelsim distribution, there is a file called mtipli.lib in Windows,
and one called libmtipli.so in Linux. On my windows computer,
I found it in $MODELSIM_INSTALL_DIR/win32pe_edu/mtipli.lib, and on
my Linux computer, I found it in  $MODELSIM_INSTALL_DIR/modeltech/linux-x86_64/libmtipli.so.

Please copy the mtipli.lib (or libmtipli.so on Linux) file into this 
directory.
